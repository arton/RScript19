<h2>Description of ActiveScriptRuby</h2>

There are two separate dlls, RScript.dll and GRScript.dll.

<h3>GlobalRubyScript</h3>

GRScript.dll (progid="GlobalRubyScript") is an engine just fit for Windows Script Host Scheme.
<br>
It has no capability to handle multiple IActiveScript interface, but very similar environment to original Ruby.exe. Because the script evaluate always in the top level context, with global name space.
<br>
In addition with CScript (not WScript), you can use STDIN/STDOUT.
<ul>
 <li>Imported Objects are referenced as Global Variable. In Ruby, the global variable starts doller sign, so
</ul>
sample script:
<pre>
 $WScript.Echo "Hello World !"
</pre>

<h3>RubyScript</h3>

RScript.dll (progid="RubyScript") is for others.
<br>
It has capability to handle multiple IActiveScript interface, each engine runs isolated name space using Ruby's module.
<ul>
 <li>Imported Modules are referenced with namespace prefix, because the environment itself is in module.
 <li>Imported Objects are referenced as Module Instance Variable. In Ruby the instance variable starts with atmark, so
</ul>
Sample script:
<pre>
 &lt;script for=window event=onload language=RubyScript&gt;
  @window.alert "Hello World !"
 &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Biorhythm Sample</h3>
There is a script in ActiveScriptRuby package (default=c:\program files\ruby\samples\biorhythm.hta) original created by OHBA. 
<DL>
<DT>biorhythm.hta
<DD>run with Internet Explorer, Interact using input object and iframe. The engine is RScript.dll.
</DL>
See the difference of how to reference Math module's method.

keywords: Math, print, Date

<h3>ViewSource Sample</h3>
This <a href="sample/viewsource.zip">sample</a> shows the power of Ruby, with HTML Application.
<br>
keywords: Socket, TCPsocket, each (iterater), regular expression

<h3>VB6 Sample with sources</h3>
This <a href="sample/VBLife.zip">sample</a> shows how to using ActiveScriptRuby with an application that hosts Script Control.
<br>
Also, it shows how to import/export each objects. VB uses Ruby object (in this sample, Lifegame controller and geometry object) and Ruby uses VB object (in this sample, the canvas object).
<br>
<em>Caution </em>, Because the version of VisualBASIC6 ported by Microsoft Japan inserts many Japanese characters into its project files, I doubt you can load them easily.

<h3>C++ Sample</h3>
What is the benefit for using ActiveScriptRuby in C++ ? <br>
In spite of Ruby has own C/C++ interface, to use ActiveScriptRuby means the application can choose its script language in uniformed style.<br>
<a href="sample/c.zip">The sample</a> illustrates how to call ActiveScript Engines. It uses RubyScript like JScript and VBScript.
