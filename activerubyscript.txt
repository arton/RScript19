ActiveScriptRuby for Ruby 1.8

Running Environment

Required Win32 and DCOM (later, I described the reason). 

     WindowsNT SP3 or later (but I never test with it) 
     Windows98 (but I never test with it) 
     Windows95 with DCOM1.1 or later (but I never test with it) 
     Windows2000
     WindowsXP

Required additional libary

If you use Windows95, then you need DCOM1.1 or later (I suppose maybe necessary updates was already included in IE5 distribution, and
Windows98). 
You are hardly recommended to get or upgrade to Internet Explorer 5.01 (I've never checked in 3.x and 4.x), whether you like or not, whether
you navigate in Internet with it or not (indeed, I never navigate in Internet with IE, sorry). 

Distribution Condition

ActiveScriptRuby is freely redistributal product under GPL2.
